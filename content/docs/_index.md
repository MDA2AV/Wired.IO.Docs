Wired.IO is a high-performance, embeddable HTTP server for .NET. Built for developers who need full control and minimal overhead, it integrates seamlessly with the IHost model, making it ideal for microservices, embedded control panels, and custom protocol handlers. Use the built-in HTTP/1.1 support out of the box, or implement your own handler to take full control of the wire. This documentation covers everything you need to get started â€” from setup and configuration to extending the pipeline and handling requests your way.
