**Wired.IO** is a lightweight, embeddable HTTP server for .NET — built as a minimal alternative to Kestrel. It runs on .NET 8+ and is ideal for low-overhead applications where performance and control matter.

Unlike traditional servers, Wired.IO is designed to be fully integrated into your own application — no external processes, no abstraction layers you don't control. It works seamlessly with the `.NET` hosting model by implementing `IHost`, allowing you to run it alongside background services, workers, and other infrastructure using the standard dependency injection and lifecycle system.

⚡ Whether you need a simple control interface, a high-throughput microservice, or a deeply integrated HTTP endpoint in a non-web app — Wired.IO gives you precise control with near-zero overhead.
