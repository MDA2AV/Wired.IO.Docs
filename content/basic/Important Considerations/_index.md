This section explores basic examples and use cases for starting users.


Through all the examples in this section the default Http11Express Handler is used, meaing that HTTP 1.1 is considered. There are not implementations for HTTP 2 or HTTP 3 in this framework, nor any plans to do so, it is however possible to create a custom handler to modify the HTTP 1.1 protocol to achieve similar capabilities, these won't however be compatible with web browsers.
