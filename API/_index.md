*Under Construction*

This section provides detailed documentation for core interfaces, classes, records, and enums used in the framework. It is intended for developers who want to understand the internal components of the HTTP server, integrate custom logic, or extend its capabilities.

Each type is grouped by category (e.g., interfaces, records, enums) and includes summaries, usage details, and links to relevant parts of the system. Whether you're implementing your own request context, building middleware, or customizing protocol behavior, this reference will guide you through the available APIs.
